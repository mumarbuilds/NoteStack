##turning a physical linux server into a vm on proxmox##->Working



$ sudo dd if=/dev/sda bs=4M status=progress | ssh root@10.14.1.20 'dd of=/var/lib/vz/images/u24_linux.img"



-->Create a new VM on Proxmox Host
Note:- dont select the image, in disk create a disk of (making an image of you have backed up using dd) for the vm, also the memory later you can change,

Go to hardware and deatch the disk and remove it.

-->convert IMG to qcow2 formate for proxmox to use

$ qemu-img convert -p -f raw -O qcow2 u24_linux.img u24_linux.qcow2


-->Import the new file into our VM ID 102(example)

$qm importdisk 102 /var/lib/vz/images/u24_linux.qcow2 local

-->got VM hardware you will select and edit the unused disk 0(uncheck IP thread and click) Add

sudo dd if=/dev/sda bs=4M status=progress of=/path/to/local/folder/u24_linux.img

Explanation:
if=/dev/sda: Input file (the disk you want to copy).

bs=4M: Block size of 4 megabytes for faster copying.

status=progress: Shows real-time progress during the operation.

of=/path/to/local/folder/plex_linux.img: Output file saved to your specified local directory.

example;- 
mkdir -p ~/images
sudo dd if=/dev/sda bs=4M status=progress of=~/images/u24_linux.img

This will create a complete bit-by-bit copy of /dev/sda as u24_linux.img in the ~/images/ directory on your local machine .

Additional Notes:
Ensure you have sufficient disk space in the target location.

Run with sudo to avoid permission issues when reading from /dev/sda.

You can monitor progress due to the status=progress option . if you are using the older vm it may not support you can skip.
