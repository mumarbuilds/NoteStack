You have unmet dependencies.

Possible cause of unmet dependencies could be corrupted package database and packages weren't installed properly. Try to trun the following commands to fix:

sudo apt-get clean

and

sudo apt-get autoclean

Resolve dependencies using:

sudo apt-get -f install

The -f option is "fix broken". apt will try to correct broken dependencies.

Then run:

sudo dpkg --configure -a

Finally run again:

sudo apt-get -f install
